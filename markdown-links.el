;;; markdown-links.el --- insert Markdown links from various sources -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
;;
;; Author: Andreas Jonsson <ajdev8@gmail.com>
;; Maintainer: Andreas Jonsson <ajdev8@gmail.com>
;; URL: https://github.com/sonofjon/markdown-links.el
;; Version: 0.1
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "30.1") (markdown-mode "2.7"))
;; Keywords: markdown, links, convenience
;;
;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This small library provides a single helper and five interactive
;; commands to insert Markdown inline links from different sources:
;;  - files on disk
;;  - open buffers
;;  - project files
;;  - git-tracked files
;;  - dired marked files
;;
;; All commands delegate to `markdown-links-insert-links`, which
;; inserts one inline link per file, using the fileâ€™s basename as
;; link text.
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;;   (use-package markdown-links
;;     :load-path "/path/to/where/you/put/markdown-links.el"
;;     :commands (markdown-links-insert-from-files
;;                markdown-links-insert-from-buffers
;;                markdown-links-insert-from-project
;;                markdown-links-insert-from-git
;;                markdown-links-insert-from-dired))
